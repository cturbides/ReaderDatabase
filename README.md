# ReaderDatabase
## _Tool for all reader's notes_

This app helps you to take, update, delete and read all your book's notes and
insights. Also, it helps you to have a unknow words list with their respective
definition. ReaderDatabase is clean, lightweight and easier to use.
Each book has a option to export in Google keep's format (something created by me that 
makes possible understand the difference between a note, unknow word and quote).
